## About Me

Hey, I'm Jad, a cybersecurity student with a deep interest in offensive security and penetration testing. I enjoy finding vulnerabilities, understanding attack surfaces, and building tools that help explore them.

-  Working toward a career in **penetration testing**
-  Exploring web security, CTFs, and vulnerability research
-  Currently building **VunLab Web** a hands-on vulnerability lab environment
-  Always learning, always breaking (things, not laws)
